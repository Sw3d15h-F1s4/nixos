# Todo List:

1 - Neovim config
    - Nixvim?
    - Merge Kickstart?
    - LSP?
    - Vanilla has been fine so far!

2 - Modularize
    - Reconcile sam-laptop and sam-desktop
    - learn more about the nix programming language
    - rethink file heirarchy

    a) find common settings and try to refactor?


# File Tree
flake.nix - attr set with {description=; inputs=; outputs => func;}


# Common Settings list

welp im stuck with samjt cuz i dont feel like fixing it - i'll have to reinstall on sam-laptop anyway.


# Functional functionizing??

I have two machines, each with some common settings, the same users, but also some different settings too. Here's what we got:

sam-desktop
  - AMD cpu
  - AMD gpu
  - SATA SSD, SATA HDD, NVME
