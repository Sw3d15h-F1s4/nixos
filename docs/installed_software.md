# A Discussion of Installed Software

Because, frankly, I don't really have a list of what I (1) need, (2) want, (3) don't need.

Oh, and I'd like to explain why, for posterity's sake.

I'm a bit confused on if I should install things with nixos or home-manager, especially since there isn't a good reference on if something is
`programs.(program).enable = true;`. So, let's figure out some software.

I'll make a distinction between what I consider "desktop" software and "system" software, as I think this is a good distinction on whether to install
with home-manager or not. I think this boils down to a few factors.

 1) How configurable is the software?
   - If there are home-manager modules for the software, it might be a good idea to install with home-manager.
   - If the software doesn't need configuration (ever), it's likely a good idea to install system wide.
 2) What methods are available?
   - Is the software on Nixpkgs? 
      - If so, is there a nixos module (`programs.${program}.enable`)? Should probably use this method, as there may be additional tweaks.
      - Refer back to 1, if there is a home-manager module then that could be useful
 3) Who will use the software?
   - Well, tbh, I'll be the only user of my computer, likely. But, theoretically, should this software be available to all users?
     - If the software can be used by anyone with little to no configuration, then sure!
       - notable exceptions: neovim, as that is the default text editor on my system. nano will exist too.

The whole reason I'm using NixOS is for immutability -- that is, I don't want to be able to break my system, even intentionally. Software should be installed globally, if at all possible.
I think this means that I want to use home-manager as a nixos module. I'll have to rethink my configuration.

For the sake of this list, and the rest of my sanity, let's follow a rigorous algorithm to determine if something should be installed as a home package or a system package.

Install everything through nixpkgs.

Binaries are installed through NixOS.

Dotfiles are managed by home-manager. Keep exceptions minimal.

I think this is the best solution.


# List of Software

## Format
Columns: Name, Priority (lower number = higher priority), System or User, Module available?

### Priority (P)
0 is the highest priority, get these installed and configured first.

### System or User
Using the guidelines listed above, should this package be available system wide?

### Module
Whether or not a `programs.${program_name}.enable` exists. If yes and I want to use it, then YES. If none exists, then NO!
If it exists but I don't think its required (or home-manager does it better), then EH!
If home-manager does it better then HM
If I should probably install with a nixos module but configure with HM, then Y&HM.

### Things I found that Could Be Cool (to format later)
 - git LFS (nixos module)



# What to Install
So, this begs the question. What software do I actually want to install? I should do this based on categories.


## Office Suite: OnlyOffice-bin latest
Of course, I'll need an office suite. This is hotly debated between OnlyOffice and LibreOffice.
OnlyOffice simlply has better visuals. People say it's more Word compatible too, which is helpful since my 
university is 100% micsrosoft.
No config needed

## Image editor: Krita and GIMP, Inkscape

Next, I need some way to edit images. The classic choices are GIMP, Krita, Pinta, and some others
TBH I don't mind installing both GIMP and Krita.
Note: GIMP plugins can also be installed from nixpkgs!

Inkscape because vector images are a whole different beast
no config needed


## Video Editor: Davinci Resolve
TBH I'm not sure whether to go with DaVinci Resolve or Kdenlive. I've used DaVinci in the past, so I'll try it.
no config needed


## Text Editor: Neovim (and vscode)
OK OK OK I GET IT. Sometimes vscode with a vim plugin is fine, like when dealing with arduino or much larger projects.
Neovim is a text editor, not an IDE. As much as we can add plugins to do so, I'm sorry but the debugging/IDE experience
provided by vscode is simply better out-of-the-box.

That being said, I'll basically use neovim for pretty much everything. Would be cool to add neovide (or any other neovim gui).
heavy config needed for both


## Games: Steam, Lutris.

## Main shell
I like fish. its super easy to use and customize. Zsh is cool and compliant or whatever, but like hit em with the exec bash if you need it.
plus making a usable zsh config is harder than nixos.

I likely won't maintain this list of software beyond initial reasoning. After all, another reason I want to use NixOS is to make installing new
software dead simple: add a line/file, rebuild, forget about it. If you want to see what software I use currently, reading nix configs is a
useful skill to develop (for me as well!). It's something I like about NixOS; the less I have to read `apt list --installed | grep manual` the better.
